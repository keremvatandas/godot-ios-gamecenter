# Status: Market Ready Game Center Plugin

## Current status

- Written specification drafted after maintainer approval of the Market-ready Core 1.0
  direction.
- Implementation is intentionally not started; awaiting written spec review.

## Decisions

- Product scope: focused Core 1.0, not full GameKit bindings.
- Compatibility: Godot 4.5-4.7 official single precision, iOS 14+, macOS 11+.
- Existing API remains stable; `panel_closed` and `panel_failed` are additive.
- Modern `GKLeaderboard` API is retained; no deprecated iOS 12/13 fallback.
- Current Godot Asset Store with direct version ZIP upload is the primary publication
  channel; no legacy Asset Library dist branch is planned.
- External publication actions require a separate final approval.

## Validation history

- 2026-09-04: repository, source, build, workflow, package, and binary baseline audited.
- 2026-09-04: latest CI run confirmed successful build with three iOS availability
  warnings that Core 1.0 must eliminate.
- 2026-09-04: CI artifact verified to contain all declared binaries and combined MIT
  notices; missing add-on README confirmed.
- 2026-09-04: CI macOS minimum observed as 14.0; local build minimum observed as 26.0;
  nondeterministic deployment target confirmed.
- 2026-09-04: Godot/Apple/Asset Store primary documentation and existing Store
  competition reviewed.
- 2026-09-04: independent Codex-Fugu read-only audit completed with `REQUEST CHANGES`.
- 2026-09-04: spec self-review completed for placeholders, contradictions, scope, and
  ambiguity.

## Blockers and open questions

- Maintainer review of the written specification is required before the detailed
  implementation plan.
- Gridlord name usage, repository visibility, public version/tag, release publication,
  and Store submission remain release-stage decisions.

## Next step

- Obtain written spec approval.
- Invoke the writing-plans workflow and produce the detailed, test-first implementation
  plan.
